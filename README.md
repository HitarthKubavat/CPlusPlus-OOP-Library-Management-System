# CPlusPlus-OOP-Library-Management-System

This repository showcases a Library Management System (LMS.CPP) designed to demonstrate fundamental Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in C++. Written in a style compatible with classic compilers like Turbo C++, the system is structured around the Book and Patron classes, which are excellent examples of Encapsulation. The Library class acts as the system controller, managing these objects using fixed-size C++ arrays to simulate collections. The core logic involves state management, specifically using check_out() and check_in() methods to control a book's availability. This project is ideal for students learning the basics of C++ class structures and how to build a basic system with separate data and logic concerns. It utilizes legacy headers (iostream.h) and C-style string functions (strcmp, strcpy), making it valuable for understanding the evolution of C++ development.
